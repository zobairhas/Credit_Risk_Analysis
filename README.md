# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
Assist the client to predict credit risk using a variety of Resampling Models and algorithms. 

## Methodology
Tools/Programs/Languages used:

- imbalanced-learn library
- scikit-learn library
- ETL
- Machine Learning

I oversampled data via RandomOverSample and SMOTE algorithms using credit card credit dataset from LendingClub. ClusterCentroids algorithm was used to undersample the data. SMOTEENN algorithm was used for over-and-undersampling. Then I used two machine learning models to predict credit risk.

## Summary of Results

- Accuracy score of Random Oversampling using ```RandomOVersampler```
- Accuracy score was 0.657 which means that the model was correct 65.7% of the time.

- Accuracy score of SMOTE Oversampling using ```SMOTE```
- Accuracy score was 0.662 which means that the model was correct 66.2% of the time.

## Recommendations

 - Overall, the models had pretty average accuracy scores. The clear winner was the ML model using ```EasyEnsembleClassifier```. 
 - Accuracy score is much higher compared to any of the other models.
